<h1><a class="anchor" name="known_issues">Known issues </a></h1>Here is a list of known issues:<p>
<ul>
<li>On Mac OS the options 'Switch to SDI view' and 'Switch to MDI view' freeze the program. The reason is unknown, because the feature workes well on Windows and Linux, but it seems that a bug in Qt is responsible. If you encounter this problem, you can hard-code your preferred view by editing the method <a class="el" href="class_c_editor.html#e9f40015621d3d2310545e9c540bc94c" title="Initializes and shows the editor.">CEditor::init()</a> in <a class="el" href="editor_8cpp.html" title="Implements CEditor.">editor.cpp</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li>On Mac OS and Windows XP there is a problem with button colors. Several buttons in the GUI bring up a color selection dialog when clicked. The selected color is then used as the button's background color. Unfortunately, this does not work on some platforms. The buttons are drawn with the system's default colors. This appears on Mac OS and Windows XP. On Windows XP, this problem appears only when using the default theme. When switching to the 'classic' theme, the buttons are drawn correctly. The behaviour on Windows Vista is unknown and not tested. The reasons is unknown, but seems to be a bug in Qt or in the underlying operating system. A possible workaround whould be to use a built-in style of Qt, where Qt draws everything by itself. </li></ul>
